    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled in the mobile game
      developed by CodeQuest Academy ("we", "our", or "us").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Our app does not require you to provide personal information such as your real name,
      email address, or phone number to play.
      You may choose a display player name, which does not need to be your real name
      and is shown only inside the game for in-game identification.
      If you choose to use the "Sync progress via Google Play" feature, we will receive
      your Google Play Games player ID and your Google Play Games player name from Google.
      These are used only to link your game progress to your account so that you can restore it on different devices, and to help verify your identity if you request data deletion.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Automatically Collected</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, location data,
      contacts, camera data, or similar tracking data.
      When you enable the sync feature described above, we store your game progress on our
      servers associated with your Google Play Games player ID and player name.
    </p>

    <h2>Cloud Save and Google Play Games</h2>
    <p>
      The "Sync progress via Google Play" button uses Google Play Games Services to
      authenticate you and provide us with your Google Play Games player ID and player name.
      We use these only to save and restore your game progress across devices and to help verify your identity if you request data deletion. We do not use them for marketing, profiling, or advertising purposes.
      We do not receive your Google account password or direct access to your email address or other Google profile information from Google Play Games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google may collect and process data independently of us when you use Google Play
      Games Services. This processing is governed by Google's own privacy policy, which
      you can review at
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Payments</h2>
    <p>
      The app may offer optional in-app purchases in the future.
      Payments are processed securely through third-party payment providers such as
      Google Play Billing and other supported payment platforms (e.g., PayPal or PayMongo).
      We do not collect or store any payment or financial information.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      While we do not directly collect user data, third-party services used for
      payment processing may collect information as required to complete transactions.
      These services operate under their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe that a child has provided personal information, please contact us
      and we will take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We value your trust and strive to protect user data.
      If you use the sync feature, your game progress and associated Google Play Games
      player ID are stored on our servers.
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect this data
      and do not share it with third parties except as described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2 id="data-deletion">Your Choices and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Use of the "Sync progress via Google Play" feature is optional.
      You can continue to play the game without enabling sync, in which case we will not
      receive your Google Play Games player ID or player name, nor store your progress on our servers.
      If you would like us to delete the game progress associated with your Google Play
      Games player ID, you may either:
      <ul>
        <li>Contact us at the email address below and include your request and, if possible, your Google Play Games player name; or</li>
        <li>Fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegtFmGEfpn6G_LYaz2R2XgPY9VvPlBIGlxohhYz4rGW2ocBA/viewform?usp=dialog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Form for account deletion</a> and provide your Google Play Games player name.</li>
      </ul>
      This helps us verify and process your deletion request securely.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Any changes will be posted on this page.
    </p>
